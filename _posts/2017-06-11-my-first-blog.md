title: Why Learn R?
---

With Machine Learning and Big Data being a hot topic in today's tech world, few questions that come up among beginners include:
> Where do I start?  

> What programming language should I learn?

I am not an R-pro, but definitely pro-R.  So, you may hear a more biased response from me.  Yes, R should be your starting point. R is primarily used for statistical analysis and is very popular among academic scientists and researchers. R is well known for its visualization capabilities and data manipulation techniques.  As you may already know or heard before, data wrangling is a very time-consuming process and R offers several packages to tidy up your data and get it to a format that can be absorbed by the model. 

Clearly, there is no single programming language that is perfect for every data problem.  Having said that, you should definitely consider learning Python or other languages at some point.  But, focus on learning R to an extent where you can comfortably build models and fine-tune them as well.
