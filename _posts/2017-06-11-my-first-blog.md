title: Why Learn R?
---

With Machine Learning and Big Data being a hot topic in today's tech world, few questions that come up among beginners include:
> Where do I start?
> What programming language should I learn?

I am not an R-pro, but definitely pro-R.  So, you may hear a more biased response from me.  Yes, R should be your starting point. R is primarily used for statistical analysis and is very popular among academic scientists and researchers.  Clearly, there is no single programming language that is perfect for every data problem.  Having said that, you should definitely consider learning Python at some point.  But, focus on learning R to an extent where you can comfortably build models and fine-tune them as well.
