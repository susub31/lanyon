### <strong> Safety Monitor </strong>

Safety Monitor is a tool, that uses Object Detection using YOLOv3 and Deep Learning on the Edge to monitor safety of workers at construction sites.  This tool can be deployed at sites and can take in video streams from a camera, process and alert a supervisor when it finds workers who are not wearing their personal protective equipment.

### <strong> Adventure Time </strong>

Adventure Time is a tool that can help plan your next road trip. This is a live web app, that leverages a large publicly available dataset of businesses in the US, with location and (preferably) rating information. It can take in user preferences for up to four people and provide an optimized itinerary, based on what the user input about the length of the road trip and ratings of various categories of attractions.

It helps you plan a road trip between two US cities, for up to four people with varied interests. It also balances the interests of the group and takes into account the amount of driving you want to do each day. The tool presents you a proposed route with a list of interesting and fun attractions and provides the options to customize based on your interests. Once you finalize the route, it displays a final itinerary with suggestions for restaurants and accommodation along the way.

### <strong> Identify Heart Disease Risk Factors from Clinical Notes  </strong>

NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a specialized aspect of Machine Learning that deals with text data mining and handling.  It is certainly one of the most challenging tasks within the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.  Our task was to identify risk factors for heart disease from clinical text.  There is wealth of information in clinical text, that can be leveraged using NLP and Deep Learning techniques. This work proposes a novel way of using stacked embeddings, as a way to improve on work that has already been done in this space as part of i2b2 2014 challenge.

This involved several approaches, building multiple models and leverage the power of BERT pre-trained models and training them on Google Cloud TPU.  One of the aspects we focused on was the nature of the data and how both character embedding and BERT Embedding (for its contextual embedding) would work together.  So, by stacking embeddings, (conceptually a way to combine multiple embeddings), we were able to obtain excellent results on the i2b2 heart disease risk factors challenge dataset. For this, we used Flair package and stacked BERT and character embeddings (BERT-CHAR Embedding), as well as PubMed (forward and backward) embeddings.  


### <strong>Research Paper</strong>

Co-authored a research paper titled “A stochastic model for automated teller machines subject to catastrophic failures and repairs” with Prof. Chakravarthy, Kettering University (Flint, MI), which has been submitted for publication.  The study applies queuing theory and models arrival of customers as Markovian arrival process (MAP) with a phase-type distribution; analysis of outcomes under different conditions and interpretation through visualizations in R

### <strong>Presentation at Conference</strong>
 
Performed a case study across multiple datasets to show how accuracy of models can be enhanced by applying clustering techniques across various modeling techniques.  Datasets include: 
*	Predict Medicare reimbursement costs 
*	Predict Increase in Solar Energy Generation 
*	Predict increase / decrease in Stock prices 

Presented the findings as a paper titled “Comparing Accuracy of Models Built on Subpopulation vs. Entire Population” at the 2016 International Conference on Business Analytics and Intelligence, India.
