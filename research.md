### <strong>Research Paper</strong>

Co-authored a research paper titled “A stochastic model for automated teller machines subject to catastrophic failures and repairs” with Prof. Chakravarthy, Kettering University (Flint, MI), which has been submitted for publication.  The study applies queuing theory and models arrival of customers as Markovian arrival process (MAP) with a phase-type distribution; analysis of outcomes under different conditions and interpretation through visualizations in R

### <strong>Presentation at Conference</strong>
 
Performed a case study across multiple datasets to show how accuracy of models can be enhanced by applying clustering techniques across various modeling techniques.  Datasets include: 
*	Predict Medicare reimbursement costs 
*	Predict Increase in Solar Energy Generation 
*	Predict increase / decrease in Stock prices 

Presented the findings as a paper titled “Comparing Accuracy of Models Built on Subpopulation vs. Entire Population” at the 2016 International Conference on Business Analytics and Intelligence, India.
